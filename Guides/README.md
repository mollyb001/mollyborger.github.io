### **Guides**
Comprehensive user-facing materials such as user guides, installation guides, and onboarding documentation. I created all content using my own software environment and guidance from SMEs. These are available in our Documentation Portal an din our ChatBot.


➡️ **Support Notes:** These guides are designed to assist Support staff in helping customers with very specific workflows or issues.

➡️ **Release Notes:** I update this guide every sprint (2 weeks) and push in GitHub so that it is automatically delivered to customers in the installation package and is build-sepcific. As I say, if you installed the software, then you have the release notes.

➡️ **Quick Start Guides:** I created these after receiving feedback from Support that many of our customers were training operators. They wanted minimum text and maximum visuals for specific workflows. 

➡️ **API Guide:** An example of an API guide I have maintained for several years. When the developer adds new messages, I update this doc.

➡️ **Installation Guide:** A large, comprehensive guide covering softare and hardware installation instructions. 

➡️ **Requirements Guide:** Our product evolved rapidly in the last 5 years and needed a comprehensive software and hardware requirements guide outside of the simple table in the installation guide.

➡️ **Quality Module Guides:** These are an example of a specific feature set within the overall software. I helped design the feature and QA it.
